Building this blog framework makes my day.
learned a lot of new things which just blows my mind,such as
- css override priority stuff
- jekyll directory structures
- liquid grammar, and some useful vim operations
- using a plugin [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) to redirect '/' to '/about'

it's a good start and a happy day to be rememebered.
